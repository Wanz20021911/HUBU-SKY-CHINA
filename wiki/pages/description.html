        <h2 id="1">1.The Food of Crops</h2>
        <p>After World War II, the global population has increased from 2.52 billion in 1950 to 7.58 billion today. The popularization and application of chemical fertilizers have promoted the growth of global grain production from 630 million tons to 2.59 billion tons in 2018, which is regarded as the material base for the population growth. Fertilizer is to crop what crop is to humans and animals, and that's why it is called 'the food of crops'. Since the birth of the first chemical fertilizer calcium superphosphate in England in 1843, chemical fertilizer has played an important role in the development of human society.</p>
        <h2 id="2">2.The Hazards of Fertilizers</h2>
        <p>The blind and excessive use of fertilizers in the world not only does harm to the organic structures of soil, depletes the basic soil fertility, but also increases the costs of grain production, and even has great negative impacts on the quality and safety of agricultural products. With the increase in fertilizer usage, in order to maintain production later, it is necessary to continue increasing the amount of fertilizer used. This is an awkward reality hiding behind the global increase in food production. It is imperative to control the total amount of fertilizers and apply fertilizer scientifically. If the control of fertilizers can not be taken seriously, the sustainable development of global agriculture will be seriously affected.</p>
        <h2 id="3">3.The Effects of Hydrogen-rich Water</h2>
        <p>In recent years, a number of studies have shown that hydrogen plays an important role in the plants' growth, development, reproduction and the improvement of soil structure. For example, on the one hand,  hydrogen can improve plant disease resistance, do good to the preservation of fruits and flowers and increase the number of rhizosphere microorganism[1]. On the other hand, hydrogen can improve plant growth, development and nutritional quality, improving plant resistance to Abiotic stress[2]ã€‚Therefore, irrigating hydrogen rich water can promote plant growth and potentially reduce the excessive use of fertilizers, protecting soil and ecological environment.</p>
        <h2 id="4">4.The Possible Solutions</h2>
        <p>The team decides to produce hydrogen rich water in a green way of Synthetic biology. The whole process is divided into two parts: NAD+ cyclic regeneration system and hydrogen production system. As a substrate, methanol is decomposed into carbon dioxide through methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, which converts NAD+ into NADH. Then, hydrogenase utilizes NADH to produce hydrogen and achieve the regeneration of NAD+. With two parts coupled, it becomes practical to produce hydrogen rich water in a green and efficient way in a liquid phase system.</p>

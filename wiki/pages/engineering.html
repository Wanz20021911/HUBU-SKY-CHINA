            <p>For the first two weeks, we mainly use a brainstorming approach to discuss each student's ideas and get a comprehensive understanding of the IGEM competition by studying the official IGEM website in detail. Every Sunday night, we hold team meetings, which are designed to get the ideas of the team members to exchange and spark innovation. The discussion process was very relaxed and the team members showed great enthusiasm, so the meeting went very smoothly.</p>

            In addition, we retested the activity of A2 and found that A2 had some activity at a PH of 5.97. However, what is puzzling is that we tested the light absorption value at 340nm of the control group with only enzyme and no substrate, and found that its value also increased to a certain extent. Theoretically, when there is no substrate reaction with enzyme, there should be no change in light absorption value.</p>

            <p class="eng-p-learn">Learn:</p>
            <p> We thought about the reason and found that when PH was 5.97, white precipitates were produced in the test cupola. We analyzed that the PH was close to the isoelectric point of protein (A2), which caused the condensation of A2, thus increasing the light absorption value. We checked the isoelectric point of methanol dehydrogenase and found that its PI was about 6.02, which confirmed the correctness of our idea. Therefore, we need to retest its activity away from the isoelectric point A2. In addition, we thought that the addition of label CL2 might affect the enzyme's active center at the 5 'end, so we gave up 2A.</p>

                We retest A2's activity by resetting a series of PH gradients around 0.5-1 away from the A2 isoelectric point. In addition, since methanol itself has an inhibitory effect on the activity of A2, we also tested the activity of A2 at different substrate concentrations.

                We have designed an experiment on the effect of hydrogen-rich water on fresh weight of plants. The detailed experimental scheme can be found in our experiment section.

            <p> In order to further study the botanical effect of hydrogen-rich water, we transplanted the seeds of Chinese cabbage after germination, and designed 4 experimental groups, which were water treatment, water and fertilizer treatment, hydrogen water treatment, and hydrogen water and fertilizer treatment.</p>
            <p class="figure"> Table 16: Treatment of the four groups</p>
            <p class="eng-p-test">Test:</p>
            <p> The results of the experiment are shown in the figure below. After 10 days of cabbage growth, the fresh weight of each group of plants was recorded.<br>
            <p class="figure"> Figure 17 Effect of hydrogen-rich water on plant growth (7 days of growth)</p>
            <p class="figure"> Figure 2: Fresh weight data of plants in each group (7 days of growth)</p>

            <p class="eng-p-learn">Learn:</p>
            <p> We found that 20ml HRW combined with 1.0g fertilizer was more effective than 20ml RO water combined with 1.0g fertilizer, so reducing fertilizer use with hydrogen-rich water may be a viable option.</p>

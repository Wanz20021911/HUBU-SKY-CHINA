					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The top priority for the HUBU-SKY-China iGEM team in 2023 is to contribute to the field of synthetic biology, paving the way for future iGEM teams and synthetic biologists. Among our many contributions, the most notable is our participation in "Experiment 1" of the 2023 Interlab study. Other notable contributions include our innovative design of a synthetic biology method for preparing hydrogen-rich water, together with the design of a protein scaffold designed to improve the efficiency of the entire hydrogen-rich water preparation system. In addition, we describe in detail the team's genetic engineering protocol and design for constructing a protocol for the preparation of hydrogen-rich water by a whole-enzyme method using methanol as a substrate, please see our engineering page for more information on this method. Finally, we uploaded all 58 parts of the design to the page specified by iGEM, including 54 basic parts and 5 composite parts, please refer to our <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/hubu-sky-china/part">part page</a> for details. This facilitates future iGEM teams and synthetic biologists, enabling them to easily modify and optimize our hydrogen-rich water preparation method.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As a leading institution in synthetic biology, iGEM acts as a testing ground for new ideas and approaches in synthetic biology. An important challenge in the field of synthetic biology is to ensure that reliable and repeatable measurements are available in different laboratories, a core element of engineering. Often, for example, it is not possible to compare fluorescence data from different LABS because they are reported in different units, or because different study groups process the data in different ways. This complicates adjusting the structure of engineered organisms, validating existing measurements, sharing data between laboratories and even interpreting experimental controls. In recent years, the iGEM team has addressed this challenge through international Interlab measurement research. In previous Interlab studies, the focus was on developing robust green fluorescent protein and cell density (OD600) measurement procedures to quantify bacterial fluorescence and cell count through the use of independent calibrators. This helped ensure consistent and comparable results in synthetic biology studies.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In 2023, the HUBU-SKY-China team contributed by participating in the "Experiment One" InterLab study.In Experiment I, our team measured the fluorescence of six devices encoding a single fluorescent protein (blue, green, or red) or two fluorescent proteins encoded in two transcription units, and we calibrated the fluorescence of these devices according to three calibration dyes and the light density of the culture according to a cell density calibrator. The data provided by our team are helping to advance research and development in the field of synthetic biology.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/hubu-sky-china/part">part page</a>  of the HUBU-SKY-China iGEM team 2023 provides a lot of information on the construction of methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, hydrogenase. Most notably, we designed a <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K4927058">protein scaffold</a> to improve the reaction efficiency of the whole system. We designed a total of 58 parts, all of which are recorded in great detail on our <a href="https://2023.igem.wiki/hubu-sky-china/part">part page</a> . For more details on how we built the whole system, please see the Engineering page. We created this part set to guide future iGEM teams in designing and modifying our proposal to meet any challenge in synthetic biology.
